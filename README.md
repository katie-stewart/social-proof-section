## My process

This was a complex challenge, with lots of parts and pieces. I thought I might try CSS Grid at first, but ultimately found that Flexbox worked better for me in this case. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Continued development

While the finished desktop and mobile sites look aligned and centered to my eye, I'm not happy with how the design collapses when going from desktop to mobile size. I'm going to work on improving this process on future projects.
